## Foster Care and Housing Insecurity: An Analytical Approach to Improving the Child Welfare System

These files represent our work to enter the 2023 TAG Data Science for Social Good Master Modeler competition. The problem statement was to better understand the relationship between housing insecurity and removal of children into foster care.

## Describe each code file 

Profiling File - Profiles for each clusters. States were divided in 4 clusters based on medians of their normal rate of removal into foster care, and their specific housing rate of removal. We then adjusted clusters based on visual representation of each cluster to better capture variance in removal rates across states.

Visualization File - Contains code to render several of the graphs and charts included in our presentation.

Tableau data refresh file - Data manipulation to calculate rates of removal, housing rates of removal, and take other steps to transform dataframes for Tableau dashboard

EDA file - exploratory data analysis of some of the key variables and relationships between variables to inform our modeling approach and storytelling for the 

Modeling Adoption Likelihood - model to predict whether or not a child will be adopted in a given year based on their foster care file attributes

Modeling Reuinification Likelihood - model to predict whether or not a child will be reuinified with their familiy in a given year out of foster care based on their foster care file attributes
